This project is inspired by Codecademy's Multiple Linear Regression lesson and the data is kindly provided by [StreetEsay](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/streeteasy-dataset).

In this project, I'll 
1. perform in-depth EDA
2. find the best hyperparameter and model using GridSearchCV.
    - models include: **Lasso Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Decision Tree**
3. answer the following business questions:
    - Does having a washer/dryer in unit increase the price of rent?
    - How costly is living by a subway station in Brooklyn/Queens?
    - Is a tenant over or underpaying?
